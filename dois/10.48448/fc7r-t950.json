Along the more than 100 000 km of Norwegian shoreline, distribution of different species varies significantly over the year, and the coastal environment varies diversely in terms of water depth, extent of intertidal areas, and degree of wave exposure. In order to address these challenges, a set of priorities and strategies have been developed towards presence of ecological groups of seabirds and shorebirds, linked to the barrier philosophy of Norwegian oil spill response. The priorities depend on a combination of temporal seabird habitat use and spill drift patterns linked to the oceanographic and seascape characteristics and needs to be linked to spill response tactics taking into account operational factors including water depth, wave exposure and access to the shoreline. This approach allows for a systematic decision support, to be applied under the spill response planning as well as operations identifying which response units and tactics to be deployed where, depending on time of the year, presence of species and operational conditions of the coastal environment.\nAuthors:\nGeir Skeie¹, Geir Helge Rødlie Systad²\n¹Akvaplan-niva, ²Norwegian Institute for Nature Research\n","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://underline.io/lecture/34647-protecting-seabirds-by-targeted-and-focused-species-specific-oil-spill-response-strategies","contentUrl":[],"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":null,"source":"api","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-01-04T12:52:59Z","registered":"2022-01-04T12:52:59Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-01-04T12:52:59Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"undsci.oopmau","type":"clients"}}}}
