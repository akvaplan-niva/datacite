Site fidelity is driven by predictable resource distributions in time and space. However, intrinsic factors related to the individual's physiology and life-history traits can contribute to consistent foraging behaviour and movement patterns. Using 11 years of continuous geolocation tracking data (fall 2008 to spring 2019), we investigated spatiotemporal consistency in non-breeding movements in a pelagic seabird population of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) breeding in the High Arctic (Svalbard). Our objective was to assess the relative importance of spatial versus temporal repeatability behind inter-annual movement consistency during winter. Most kittiwakes used pelagic regions of the western North Atlantic. Winter site fidelity was high both within and across individuals and at meso (100-1000 km) and macro scales (>1000 km), including over deep-water areas far from continental shelves. Spatial consistency in non-breeding movement was higher within than among individuals, suggesting that site fidelity might emerge from individuals' memory to return to locations with predictable resource availability. Consistency was also stronger in space than in time, suggesting that it was driven by consistent resource pulses that may vary in time more so than in space. Specialization for key wintering areas can indicate vulnerability to environmental perturbations, with winter survival and carry-over effects arising from winter conditions as potential drivers of population dynamics.\nAuthors:\nDon-Jean Léandri-Breton¹, Kyle Elliott¹, Pierre Legagneux², Børge Moe³, Olivier Chastel⁴, Arnaud Tarroux⁵, Frédéric Angelier⁴, William Jouanneau⁴, Pierre Blévin⁶, Per Fauchald⁵, Sabrina Tartu⁴, Aurélie Goutte⁷, Vegard Sandøy Bråthen⁵\n¹McGill University, ²Université Laval, ³Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), ⁴Centre d'Études Biologiques de Chizé (CEBC-CNRS) & Université de La Rochelle, ⁵Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, ⁶Akvaplan-NIVA, ⁷École Pratique des Hautes Études\n","descriptionType":"Abstract"}],"geoLocations":[],"fundingReferences":[],"url":"https://underline.io/lecture/34627-long-term-tracking-of-an-arctic-breeding-seabird-indicates-high-fidelity-for-pelagic-wintering-areas","contentUrl":[],"metadataVersion":0,"schemaVersion":null,"source":"api","isActive":true,"state":"findable","reason":null,"viewCount":0,"downloadCount":0,"referenceCount":0,"citationCount":0,"partCount":0,"partOfCount":0,"versionCount":0,"versionOfCount":0,"created":"2022-01-04T12:52:25Z","registered":"2022-01-04T12:52:25Z","published":null,"updated":"2022-01-04T12:52:25Z"},"relationships":{"client":{"data":{"id":"undsci.oopmau","type":"clients"}}}}
