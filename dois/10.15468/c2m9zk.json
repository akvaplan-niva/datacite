On each sampling date three sampling protocols were used: - a fine net deployed horizontally by a diver (100 µm mesh) - a specialized water pump (hoover/vacuum, 100 µm) deployed at a certain depth - vertical plankton net tows (WP2-net, 65 µm). Both the diver's net and vacuum pump sampled from 6 and 12 meters depth at each station, while the WP2-net sampled from 50 to 0 meters and from 12 to 0 meters depth. For station \"s2\", the sampling at 6 meters with a diver's net and vacuum pump was carried out in the autumn of 2017 and not together with the other sampling that occurred in the autumn of 2016. ## Taxonomy The dataset was analysed using image analysis software (Ecotaxa) with subsequent expert validation. ## Data ## This dataset is built using a [fully automated processing pipeline](https://github.com/akvaplan-niva/gbif-no-darwin-core/blob/main/bin/ecotaxa-pipeline), using the [ecotaxa-occurrences](https://github.com/akvaplan-niva/ecotaxa-darwin-core#ecotaxa-occurrences) ## Processing https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4700253 This dataset contains two Darwin Core distributions - dwc-ndjson: Newline separated JSON (NDJSON) - dwc-a: Darwin Core archive (TSV/XML) command line tool.
